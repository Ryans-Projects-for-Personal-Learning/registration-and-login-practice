# registration-and-login-practice
A practice project for creating a registration and login system using the PERN stack.

It's a very naive and incomplete implementation but the point was to get the basics down. As well, I'm sure there are better ways to doing this but I just wanted to make some version of it. 

Some further revisions may come if I revisit this repo.
